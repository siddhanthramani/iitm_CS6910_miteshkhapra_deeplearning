For Professor Mitesh Khapra's Deep Learning Course - CS6910

## Story time
I was working at Impact Analytics as a data scientist and was one of the few engineers who were fast-tracked to senior data scientist.
During that time, I realized that while it was a great company and I got to work on cutting-edge work, I did not understand how the cutting-edge work worked.<br> 
ie. We were using many libraries but I had no clue what made the libraries work. 

While searching for online courses which could help me bridge this gap, I came across a startup called onefourthlabs/padhai which was offering a deep learning course by IITM professors.
I had looked at many such courses but was never satisfied.<br>
This course was different. The syllabus was carefully planned to extensively cover deep learning concepts - both breadth and depth wise.
Unfortunately they had not opened the course for enrollment yet.

My quest to bridge my gap in knowledge found me an opportunity at Mindgrove - a deeptech startup based out of the IITM research park, led by some great minds.
I jumped on the opportunity, quit my job, and joined the company.
Luckily, this opportunity came up with the option to pursue courses at IIT Madras.
I had to wait three months but when the spring semester started, I wrote a mail to ask Professor Mitesh Khapra if I could join his Deep Learning course. He was kind to say yes. Incidentally he was the one offering the padhai online course.

I enrolled for his on-campus course and have been attending his lectures for the past two months. 
Till date, I have always been early to his lecture - independent of the amount of work I have that day.<br>
The main reason - it is one of the best classes that I have been to, and *Professor Mitesh Khapra is as great a communicator as he is renowned as a researcher.*

<br>

Why did I tell you this?<br>
Cause whether you are interested in deep learning or not, I want you to find some way, hook or crook, to sit in his class someday.<br>
And if you cannot find that way, enroll in his [online course](https://padhai.onefourthlabs.in/courses/dl-feb-2019). It's Rs 5K - which is a steal. (Courses usually cost Rs 50K on campus). As a big believer of affordable education (note: not free education), I confidently tell you that this is one of the most affordable courses you can ever find.<br>
**And what a bang it's worth!**
